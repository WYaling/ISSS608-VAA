This is reflected in a mean score lower than the median. This may be due to some students with extremely low scores pulling down the mean, which we can see in the following box plot.\nNext, let’s use box plot to explore more.\nBoxplot\n\nplotcode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nPV_Avg_tidy &lt;- PV_Avg %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(Avg_PVMath, Avg_PVRead, Avg_PVScience), names_to = \"Subject\", values_to = \"Score\")\n\nmax_values &lt;- PV_Avg_tidy %&gt;% group_by(Subject) %&gt;% summarise(max_value = max(Score))\n\nggplot(PV_Avg_tidy, aes(x = Subject, y = Score)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_grid(. ~ Subject, scales = \"free_x\") +\n  geom_hline(data = max_values, aes(yintercept = max_value, linetype = \"Max\"), color = \"blue\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text(data = max_values, aes(x = Subject, y = max_value, label = sprintf(\"Max: %.2f\", max_value)), size = 3, vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = median(Score), linetype = \"Median\"), color = \"red\",show.legend = FALSE) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = range(PV_Avg_tidy$Score)) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe three box plots reveal:\n\nSome students scored extremely low, especially in Reading, followed by Science and Math.\nMedian scores follow the order: Math &gt; Science &gt; Reading.\nMaximum scores follow the order: Math &gt; Science &gt; Reading.\nOver 75% of students scored above 500 in Math and 75% of students scored above 500 in Science, while less than 75% scored above 500 in Reading.\n\nNext, by using density curve, we can see more of the distribution and central tendency of the performance scores.\nDensity curve\n\nplotcode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n  peak_math &lt;- density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVMath)$x[which.max(density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVMath)$y)]\n  peak_read &lt;- density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVRead)$x[which.max(density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVRead)$y)]\n  peak_science &lt;- density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVScience)$x[which.max(density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVScience)$y)]\n  \nggplot(data = PV_Avg) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = Avg_PVMath, color = \"Math\"), fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = Avg_PVRead, color = \"Reading\"), fill = \"green\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = Avg_PVScience, color = \"Science\"), fill = \"red\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  ggtitle(\"Density of SG Students' Performance\") +\n  labs(x = \"Average of Plausible Value\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = peak_math, color = \"Math\"), linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = peak_read, color = \"Reading\"), linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = peak_science, color = \"Science\"), linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = peak_math, y = 0, label = sprintf(\"Math: %.2f\", peak_math)), \n            vjust = - 0.5, hjust = 0.2, color = \"blue\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = peak_read, y = 0, label = sprintf(\"Reading: %.2f\", peak_read)), \n            vjust = - 3.5, hjust = 0.2, color = \"green\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = peak_science, y = 0, label = sprintf(\"Science: %.2f\", peak_science)),\n            vjust = - 8, hjust = 0.2, color = \"red\", size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Math\" = \"blue\", \"Reading\" = \"green\", \"Science\" = \"red\"), name = \"Subject\") +\n  theme_test() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = c(0.9, 0.8),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    legend.key.size = unit(5, \"mm\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three density curves above reveal:\n\nThe performance for all three subjects show a tendency towards a leftward skew in their distributions.\nMath scores are centered around 600, Science scores around 580, and Reading scores around 560.\n\nLast, let’s present the distribution by violin plots.\nViolin plot\n\nplotcode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = PV_Avg) +\n  geom_violin(aes(x = \"Math\", y = Avg_PVMath, fill = \"Math\"), position = \"dodge\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_violin(aes(x = \"Reading\", y = Avg_PVRead, fill = \"Reading\"), position = \"dodge\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_violin(aes(x = \"Science\", y = Avg_PVScience, fill = \"Science\"), position = \"dodge\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  ggtitle(\"Violin Plot of SG Students' Performance\") +\n  labs(fill = \"Subject\", x = \"Subject\", y = \"Plausible Value\") +\n  theme_test() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = c(0.9, 0.9),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    legend.key.size = unit(4, \"mm\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three violin plots reveal:\n\nScores for all three subjects are mainly concentrated between 500-700.\nMath scores are centered above 600, while Reading and Science scores are primarily distributed in the 500-600 range. Moreover, the peak value for Science scores is higher than the peak value for Reading scores.\nThe performance distribution for all three subjects is left-skewed, with the lower half of the violin plots being longer.\n\n\n\n3.2.1.2 Two Subjects\n\nMath vs ReadingMath vs ScienceMath vs Reading\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=PV_Avg, \n       aes(x= Avg_PVMath, \n           y= Avg_PVRead)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method=lm, color = \"lightblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = max(Avg_PVMath), y = max(Avg_PVRead),\n                label = paste(\"y = \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVRead ~ Avg_PVMath))[2], 2), \"x + \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVRead ~ Avg_PVMath))[1], 2))),\n            hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1, color = \"pink\", size = 5) +\n  ggtitle(\"Math vs Reading\") +\n  labs(x=\"Math Score\", y=\"Reading Score\") +\n  theme_dark()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=PV_Avg, \n       aes(x= Avg_PVMath, \n           y= Avg_PVScience)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method=lm, color = \"lightblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = max(Avg_PVMath), y = max(Avg_PVScience),\n                label = paste(\"y = \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVScience ~ Avg_PVMath))[2], 2), \"x + \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVScience ~ Avg_PVMath))[1], 2))),\n            hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1, color = \"pink\", size = 5) +\n  ggtitle(\"Math vs Science\") +\n  labs(x=\"Math Score\", y=\"Science Score\") +\n  theme_dark()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=PV_Avg, \n       aes(x= Avg_PVScience, \n           y= Avg_PVRead)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method=lm, color = \"lightblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = max(Avg_PVScience), y = max(Avg_PVRead),\n                label = paste(\"y = \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVRead ~ Avg_PVScience))[2], 2), \"x + \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVRead ~ Avg_PVScience))[1], 2))),\n            hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1, color = \"pink\", size = 5) +\n  ggtitle(\"Science vs Reading\") +\n  labs(x=\"Science Score\", y=\"Reading Score\") +\n  theme_dark()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the three scatter plots above and their respective fit curves, it can be observed that the scores of the three subjects are positively correlated in pairs. As the scores in Math increase, the corresponding scores in Reading and Science also increase, with Science scores being higher. Similarly, when Reading scores are higher, Science scores also tend to be higher.\n\n\n3.2.1.3 Three Subjects\nFrom the three colored scatter plots below, we can observe a positive trend: as the scores of any two subjects increase, the score of the third subject also tends to rise. This is visually represented by lighter colors and higher values towards the upper right corner, indicating superior performance. Conversely, when the scores of any two subjects decrease, the score of the third subject tends to decrease as well, reflected in darker colors and lower values towards the lower left corner. This pattern suggests a positive correlation among the performance scores of the three subjects, highlighting that higher scores in one subject are associated with higher scores in the others.\n\nMath vs Reading with ScienceMath vs Science with ReadingReading vs Science with Math\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n       aes(x = Avg_PVMath, \n           y = Avg_PVRead, \n           color = Avg_PVScience)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Math vs Reading with Science\") +\n  labs(x = \"Math Score\", y = \"Reading Score\", color = \"Science Score\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n       aes(x = Avg_PVMath, \n           y = Avg_PVScience, \n           color = Avg_PVRead)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Math vs Science with Reading\") +\n  labs(x = \"Math Score\", y = \"Science Score\", color = \"Reading Score\") +\n  scale_color_continuous(\"Reading Score\", breaks = seq(200, 800, by = 100), \n                          low = \"red\", high = \"pink\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n       aes(x = Avg_PVRead, \n           y = Avg_PVScience, \n           color = Avg_PVMath)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Reading vs Science with Math\") +\n  labs(x = \"Reading Score\", y = \"Science Score\", color = \"Math Score\") +\n  scale_color_continuous(\"Math Score\", breaks = seq(200, 800, by = 100), \n                          low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"lightgreen\") +\n  theme_bw()"

In the lower score range (&lt;500), there are more male students, represented by the area under the curve below 500 being larger for males than females. Similarly, in the higher score range (&gt;600), there are more female students, represented by the area under the curve above 600 being larger for females than males. This suggests that the majority of female students outperform male students in reading.\nIn Science performance, female scores are concentrated below 600 (around 580), while male scores are concentrated above 600 (around 610). This indicates that the majority of male students perform better in science than the majority of female students. In the higher score range (&gt;600), there are more male students, represented by the area under the curve above 600 being larger for males than females.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Summary"

Two schools scored above 700, while two schools had notably lower scores around 400.\nIn Reading, majority of schools show scores between 450-550, followed by 550-650. Five schools scored above 650, but two schools had notably low scores, falling below 400, with one even below 350.\nIn Science, In most schools, students scored between 500-600, followed by 600-700. Two schools scored high (around 700), while two schools scored low (under 400).\nThe three plots’ shapes are similar, indicating consistent performance across subjects. Schools either perform well, average, or poorly in all subjects. Few schools show better reading performance than in math and science.\nTwo schools consistently excel (upper left), while two consistently perform poorly (lower right) across all subjects.\nThough subtle, there’s a slight downward trend in the fit curve, suggesting that as school codes increase, scores may potentially decrease.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Summary"
