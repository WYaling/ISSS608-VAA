Nearly 75% of students scored above 500 in overall knowledge performance, with a few extremely low scorers below 300.\n\nNext, by using density curve, we can see more of the distribution and central tendency of the performance scores.\nDensity curve\n\n\nShow the code\n  peak_math &lt;- density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVMath)$x[which.max(density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVMath)$y)]\n  peak_read &lt;- density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVRead)$x[which.max(density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVRead)$y)]\n  peak_science &lt;- density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVScience)$x[which.max(density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVScience)$y)]\n  peak_overall &lt;- density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVOverall)$x[which.max(density(PV_Avg$Avg_PVOverall)$y)]\n  \nggplot(data = PV_Avg) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = Avg_PVMath, color = \"Math\"), fill = \"darkblue\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = Avg_PVRead, color = \"Reading\"), fill = \"darkgreen\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = Avg_PVScience, color = \"Science\"), fill = \"darkred\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = Avg_PVOverall, color = \"Overall\"), fill = \"orange\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  ggtitle(\"Density of Performance Scores\") +\n  labs(x = \"Average of PV\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = peak_math, color = \"Math\"), linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = peak_read, color = \"Reading\"), linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = peak_science, color = \"Science\"), linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = peak_overall, color = \"Overall\"), linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = peak_math, y = 0, label = sprintf(\"Math: %.2f\", peak_math)), \n            vjust = - 0.5, hjust = 0.2, color = \"royalblue\", size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = peak_read, y = 0, label = sprintf(\"Reading: %.2f\", peak_read)), \n            vjust = - 3.5, hjust = 0.2, color = \"lightgreen\", size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = peak_science, y = 0, label = sprintf(\"Science: %.2f\", peak_science)),\n            vjust = - 8, hjust = 0.2, color = \"tomato\", size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = peak_overall, y = 0, label = sprintf(\"Overall: %.2f\", peak_overall)),\n            vjust = - 12, hjust = 0.5, color = \"yellow\", size = 3.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Math\" = \"royalblue\", \"Reading\" = \"lightgreen\", \"Science\" = \"tomato\", \"Overall\" = \"yellow\"), name = \"Subject\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = \"Score\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = c(0.9, 0.8),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    legend.key.size = unit(5, \"mm\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four density curves above reveal:\n\nThe performance for all three subjects and overall show a tendency towards a leftward skew in their distributions.\nMath scores are centered around 600, science scores around 580, and reading scores around 560. Overall, students’ knowledge performance scores are centered around 590.\n\nLast, let’s present the distribution of performance scores by violin plots.\nViolin plot\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = PV_Avg) +\n  geom_violin(aes(x = \"Math\", y = Avg_PVMath, fill = \"Math\"), position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_violin(aes(x = \"Reading\", y = Avg_PVRead, fill = \"Reading\"), position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_violin(aes(x = \"Science\", y = Avg_PVScience, fill = \"Science\"), position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_violin(aes(x = \"Overall\", y = Avg_PVOverall, fill = \"Overall\"), position = \"dodge\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Violin Plot of Performance Scores\") +\n  labs(x = \"Subject\", y = \"Score\", fill = \"Subject\") +\n  theme_classic() \n\n\n\n\n\nThe similarity in the thickness of the violin plots above suggests that the scores for mathematics, reading, science, and overall performance share a certain degree of similarity in the central tendency and dispersion of their data distributions. However, the violin plot for reading exhibits a noticeably longer tail, indicating that the values for reading scores in the tail are relatively scattered, with the presence of more outliers. In contrast, the tails for the other two subjects as well as the overall scores are shorter, indicating a relatively concentrated distribution of data in the lower score range.\n\n\n3.2.2 Two Subjects\nNow, let’s see if there is any correlation between the scores in any two subjects.\n\n\nShow the code\np5 &lt;- ggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n             aes(x = Avg_PVMath, \n                 y = Avg_PVRead)) +\n        geom_point(color = \"royalblue\") +\n        geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = lm, color = \"black\") +\n        geom_text(aes(x = max(Avg_PVMath), y = max(Avg_PVRead),\n                      label = paste(\"y = \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVRead ~ Avg_PVMath))[2], 2), \"x + \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVRead ~ Avg_PVMath))[1], 2))),\n                  hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1, color = \"black\", size = 4) +\n        ggtitle(\"Math vs Reading\") +\n        labs(x = \"Math Score\", y = \"Reading Score\", color = \"Math Score\") +\n        theme_classic()\np6 &lt;- ggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n             aes(x = Avg_PVMath, \n                 y = Avg_PVScience)) +\n        geom_point(color = \"forestgreen\") +\n        geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = lm, color = \"black\") +\n        geom_text(aes(x = max(Avg_PVMath), y = max(Avg_PVScience),\n                      label = paste(\"y = \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVScience ~ Avg_PVMath))[2], 2), \"x + \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVScience ~ Avg_PVMath))[1], 2))),\n                  hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1, color = \"black\", size = 4) +\n        ggtitle(\"Math vs Science\") +\n        labs(x = \"Math Score\", y = \"Science Score\", color = \"Math Score\") +\n        theme_classic()\np7 &lt;- ggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n             aes(x = Avg_PVRead, \n                 y = Avg_PVScience)) +\n        geom_point(color = \"tomato\") +\n        geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = lm, color = \"black\") +\n        geom_text(aes(x = max(Avg_PVRead), y = max(Avg_PVScience),\n                      label = paste(\"y = \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVScience ~ Avg_PVRead))[2], 2), \"x + \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVScience ~ Avg_PVRead))[1], 2))),\n                  hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1, color = \"black\", size = 4) +\n        ggtitle(\"Reading vs Science\") +\n        labs(x = \"Reading Score\", y = \"Science Score\", color = \"Reading Score\") +\n        theme_classic()\n\np5/p6|p7\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above three plots and their respective fit curves, it can be observed that the scores of the three subjects are positively correlated in pairs. As the scores in math increase, the scores in reading and science also increase, with science scores being higher. Similarly, when reading scores are higher, science scores also tend to be higher.\n\n\n3.2.3 Three Subjects\nNext, let’s see if there is any relationship among three subject’s scores.\n\nMath vs Reading with ScienceMath vs Science with ReadingReading vs Science with Math\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n       aes(x = Avg_PVMath, \n           y = Avg_PVRead, \n           color = Avg_PVScience)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Math vs Reading with Science\") +\n  labs(x = \"Math Score\", y = \"Reading Score\", color = \"Science Score\") +\n  theme_clean()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n       aes(x = Avg_PVMath, \n           y = Avg_PVScience, \n           color = Avg_PVRead)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Math vs Science with Reading\") +\n  labs(x = \"Math Score\", y = \"Science Score\", color = \"Reading Score\") +\n  scale_color_continuous(\"Reading Score\", breaks = seq(200, 800, by = 100), \n                          low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"lightgreen\") +\n  theme_clean()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n       aes(x = Avg_PVRead, \n           y = Avg_PVScience, \n           color = Avg_PVMath)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Reading vs Science with Math\") +\n  labs(x = \"Reading Score\", y = \"Science Score\", color = \"Math Score\") +\n  scale_color_continuous(\"Math Score\", breaks = seq(200, 800, by = 100), \n                          low = \"red\", high = \"pink\") +\n  theme_clean()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the three colored scatter plots above, we can observe a positive trend: as the scores of any two subjects increase, the score of the third subject also tends to rise. This is visually represented by lighter colors and higher values towards the upper right corner. Conversely, when the scores of any two subjects decrease, the score of the third subject tends to decrease as well, reflected in darker colors and lower values towards the lower left corner. This pattern suggests a positive correlation among the performance scores of the three subjects, highlighting that higher scores in one subject are associated with higher scores in the others."

across the three subjects and overall.\nIn terms of math performance, female scores being concentrated around 600, while male scores are concentrated around 650 suggests that, on average, males tend to achieve slightly higher scores in math compared to females.\nRegarding reading performance, the concentration of both male and female scores around 550-600, approximately at 580, suggests that there is a similarity in the average performance of both genders in Reading. However, the observed differences in the lower and higher score ranges indicate certain gender-related patterns. The larger area under the curve below 500 for males implies that more male students fall into the lower score range (&lt;500). Conversely, the larger area above 600 for females suggests that more female students achieve scores in the higher range (&gt;600).\nIn science performance, the concentration of female scores below 600 (around 580), and male scores above 600 (around 610), indicates that, on average, the majority of male students outperform the majority of female students in Science. The larger area under the curve above 600 for males in the higher score range further supports this observation, suggesting that more male students achieve scores in the upper range (&gt;600) compared to females.\nIn math, science, and overall performance, the distribution of male scores is more left-skewed compared to the distribution of female scores. This indicates that, in these subjects, male scores are relatively concentrated at higher levels. A left-skewed distribution suggests that the majority of students achieve higher scores, with relatively fewer lower scores. This implies that, overall, male students tend to perform more prominently in the higher score ranges in math, science, and overall performance.\n\nThe following set of violin plots offers a clearer comparison:\n\n\nShow the code\np16 &lt;- ggplot(data = PV_Avg_gender, \n              aes(x = as.factor(gender), y = Avg_PVMath, fill = as.factor(gender))) +\n         geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +\n         geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n         scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"1\" = \"pink\", \"2\" = \"dodgerblue\"), \n                           breaks = c(\"1\", \"2\"), \n                           labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\")) +\n         labs(fill = \"Gender\", x = NULL, y = \"Math Score\") +\n         ggtitle(\"Distribution of Math Scores by Gender\") +\n         theme_classic() +\n         theme(\n           plot.title = element_text(size = 8),\n           axis.title = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.text = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.title = element_text(size = 8)) \n\np17 &lt;- ggplot(data = PV_Avg_gender, \n              aes(x = as.factor(gender), y = Avg_PVRead, fill = as.factor(gender))) +\n         geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +\n         geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n         scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"1\" = \"pink\", \"2\" = \"dodgerblue\"), \n                           breaks = c(\"1\", \"2\"), \n                           labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\")) +\n         labs(fill = \"Gender\", x = NULL, y = \"Reading Score\") +\n         ggtitle(\"Distribution of Reading Scores by Gender\") +\n         theme_classic() +\n         theme(\n           plot.title = element_text(size = 8),\n           axis.title = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.text = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.title = element_text(size = 8)) \n\np18 &lt;- ggplot(data = PV_Avg_gender, \n              aes(x = as.factor(gender), y = Avg_PVScience, fill = as.factor(gender))) +\n         geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +\n         geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n         scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"1\" = \"pink\", \"2\" = \"dodgerblue\"), \n                           breaks = c(\"1\", \"2\"), \n                           labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\")) +\n         labs(fill = \"Gender\", x = NULL, y = \"Science Score\") +\n         ggtitle(\"Distribution of Science Scores by Gender\") +\n         theme_classic() +\n         theme(\n           plot.title = element_text(size = 8),\n           axis.title = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.text = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.title = element_text(size = 8)) \n\n\n\np19 &lt;- ggplot(data = PV_Avg_gender, \n              aes(x = as.factor(gender), y = Avg_PVOverall, fill = as.factor(gender))) +\n         geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +\n         geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n         scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"1\" = \"pink\", \"2\" = \"dodgerblue\"), \n                           breaks = c(\"1\", \"2\"), \n                           labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\")) +\n         labs(fill = \"Gender\", x = NULL, y = \"Overall Score\") +\n         ggtitle(\"Distribution of Overall Scores by Gender\") +\n         theme_classic() +       \n         theme(\n           plot.title = element_text(size = 8),\n           axis.title = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.text = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.title = element_text(size = 8)) \n\n\n\n\np16 + p17 + p18 + p19\n\n\n\n\n\nThe violin plots for male students in math, science, and overall performance exhibit characteristics of narrower and more concentrated distributions, especially with higher scores corresponding to the widest part. This suggests that male students’ scores in these subjects are more consistent and concentrated, with a substantial portion achieving higher scores. The narrowness of the plots indicates relatively small variability in scores among male students, signifying a more uniform performance. In the widest part of the violin plot, it demonstrates that a considerable number of males perform well within this score range, further emphasizing the trend of males exhibiting concentrated and superior performance in mathematics, science, and overall academic achievement.\nIn contrast, concerning reading, the violin plots for both male and female students are generally similar, but the female plot has higher scores corresponding to the widest part. This implies that female students generally demonstrate a more balanced performance in reading, with a relatively larger proportion of females achieving higher scores. While both plots share similar overall trends, females may have a higher average score and more instances of high performance in reading. This difference reflects the relative advantage of females in reading, showcasing a more outstanding reading ability or higher academic proficiency.\n\n\n4.1.2 Summary\nBased on the above analysis, we can draw the conclusion that in math, science, and overall performance, males outperform females, with a greater number achieving higher scores. In reading, the performance difference between males and females is not significant, but there tends to be a higher number of females in the high-scoring range."

This suggests the presence of two distinct school groups with significantly different performance levels in these subjects and overall, with the larger group having lower performance.\nIn the box plots, the median line within the box for mathematics scores is the highest, indicating a higher median score. This implies that the median performance of students in mathematics is relatively better in Singaporean schools. The median line for science scores is the second-highest, suggesting a relatively higher median performance in science, though not surpassing mathematics. The lowest median line is observed in the box for reading scores, indicating a relatively lower median performance in reading. Overall, it can be inferred that students in Singaporean schools perform better in mathematics compared to science, and science performance is better than reading.\nThree schools, namely “70200001,” “702001010,” and “70200003,” exhibit consistently high scores across subjects and overall performance. On the other hand, two schools, “70200115” and “70200149,” consistently display low scores across all subjects and overall performance.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Summary\nBased on the previous analysis, we can observe that Singaporean schools can be divided into a group of high-performing schools and a group of low-performing schools. The number of high-performing schools is lower than the number of low-performing schools. Singaporean schools demonstrate a higher level of education in math compared to science and outperform reading. Three prestigious schools in Singapore exhibit outstanding performance."

Surprisingly, when parents have an ISCED level of 8 (doctoral), students’ performance in individual subjects and overall is only at a moderate level, resembling the score distribution of students with an ISCED level of 5 (certificate, diploma, and associate degree). Students with parents having an ISCED level of 4 or below demonstrate poorer performance.\nObserving the following violin plots:\n\nISCED vs MathISCED vs ReadingISCED vs ScienceISCED vs Overall\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = PV_Avg_Parent_edu_highestlevel, aes(x = Parent_highest_level, y = Avg_PVMath, fill = Parent_highest_level)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\", alpha = 1) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Blues\") +\n  labs(x = \"Parent's highest &lt;ISCED&gt; level\", y = \"Math Score\", fill = \"&lt;ISCED&gt; level\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Violin Plots with Boxplots of Math Score by Parent's Highest Education Level\") +\n  theme_clean() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = PV_Avg_Parent_edu_highestlevel, aes(x = Parent_highest_level, y = Avg_PVRead, fill = Parent_highest_level)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\", alpha = 1) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Greens\") +\n  labs(x = \"Parent's highest &lt;ISCED&gt; level\", y = \"Math Score\", fill = \"&lt;ISCED&gt; level\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Violin Plots with Boxplots of Reading Score by Parent's Highest Education Level\") +\n  theme_clean() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = PV_Avg_Parent_edu_highestlevel, aes(x = Parent_highest_level, y = Avg_PVScience, fill = Parent_highest_level)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\", alpha = 1) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Reds\") +\n  labs(x = \"Parent's highest &lt;ISCED&gt; level\", y = \"Science Score\", fill = \"&lt;ISCED&gt; level\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Violin Plots with Boxplots of Science Score by Parent's Education Level\") +\n  theme_clean() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data = PV_Avg_Parent_edu_highestlevel, aes(x = Parent_highest_level, y = Avg_PVOverall, fill = Parent_highest_level)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.3, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\", alpha = 1) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Purples\") +\n  labs(x = \"Parent's highest &lt;ISCED&gt; level\", y = \"Overall Score\", fill = \"&lt;ISCED&gt; level\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Violin Plots with Boxplots of Overall Score by Parent's Education Level\") +\n  theme_clean() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can observe the following from the above plots:\n\nSome violin plots are uni-modal, while others exhibit bi-modal shapes. Bi-modal violin plots suggest that students of parents with the same ISCED level have scores distributed into different groups, with some achieving higher scores and others scoring lower.\nViolin plots for students whose parents have an ISCED level of 8 (doctoral) are elongated in all three subjects and overall. This may indicate a wider distribution of scores across subjects, suggesting greater variability. This situation suggests that students with parents holding a doctoral degree show significant variations in performance, with some achieving high scores and others performing poorly. Compared to students with parents at other ISCED level, this reflects uncertainty and diversity in performance within doctoral family backgrounds.\nViolin plots for students whose parents have an ISCED level of 6 (bachelor’s) and 7 (master’s) are short and stout in all three subjects and overall. This suggests that these students have a relatively concentrated distribution of scores, indicating lower variability. This situation implies that most students with parents holding bachelor’s and master’s degrees exhibit a relatively consistent level of academic performance, with fewer extremes of high or low scores. Compared to students with parents at other ISCED level, these students from bachelor’s and master’s backgrounds demonstrate a more stable and consistent performance.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Home Possessions\nIn this section, the report will sum up some data in the student questionnaire data set that reflects aspects of home processions (HOMEPOS).

However, after reaching a certain point, there seems to be a decline. Specifically, when HOMEPOS values exceed 35, the performance in three subjects and overall appears to decrease. This suggests that an increase in HOMEPOS contributes positively to student performance up to a certain point, but when the HOMEPOS values become excessively high, student performance may start to decline."

Conversely, a smaller standard error suggests that the sample mean is relatively accurate, resulting in shorter error bars."

When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves.

In the raincloud plot, the “cloud” part is equivalent to a half-violin plot, serving the same function as the original violin plot. The “rain” part of the raincloud plot is a scatter plot, illustrating the differences in the number of individuals in each score range.\nThe width/height of the boxplot has been increased, presenting it as a slightly thicker line in the middle, where the thicker part represents the box.\nData points are represented as dots, with different colors filling different types of data points. Text is included to indicate the data type and value. The size of points for different data types reflects the magnitude of the values. For example, if the median is greater than the mean, the shape of the mean point is larger than that of the median point.\n\nThe improved graph facilitates readers in comparing the distribution of math scores among different gender groups. Horizontally, the position, color, and values of data points can be compared within and between groups."

This enhances the directional connection between text labels and points.\nThe subtitle explains the meaning, color, and purpose of data points and text labels.\nA horizontal reference line at a score of 550 is added for easier comparison with the median.\nThe original box plot is transformed into a combination of a box plot and a violin plot.\nDifferent transparencies are applied to the box plot and the violin plot to facilitate reader observation.\n\nThe improved graph combines both the box plot and the violin plot, making it more convenient for readers to analyze from different perspectives. Readers can now observe which schools perform exceptionally well or poorly by comparing the text labels. The addition of horizontal reference lines facilitates the comparison of median scores across different Score Types. The number of peaks in the violin plot also allows readers to identify distinct groups of schools, with one group scoring between 500-600 (larger quantity) and another group scoring between 600-700 (smaller quantity)."

The color gradient rules are explained in the legend on the right side of the graph.\nThe red mean lines have been removed. Instead, comparisons between groups are made using gradient color and peak of the density plot, as the central light portion of the gradient color precisely represents the 50% position.\n\nThe improved graph clearly illustrates the density distribution of mathematics scores for different ISCED levels. By comparing the positions of the peaks in each graph or examining the location of the lightest color areas, readers can understand the differences in mathematics scores among children of mothers with different educational levels. For instance, in the graph, when the mother’s education level is ISCED level 3.3, their children tend to have higher mathematics scores compared to other levels. This is because the position of the lightest color area is furthest to the right, indicating that the higher 50% of the children are distributed in the higher score range. In contrast, the 50% score range for children in the other three levels is relatively lower."
