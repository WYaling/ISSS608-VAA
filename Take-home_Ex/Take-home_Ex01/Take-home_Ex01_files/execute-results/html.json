Data Source: PISA 2022\n\n[PISA](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/) is the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/about/) Programme for International Student Assessment. PISA measures 15-year-olds’ ability to use their reading, mathematics and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges. In this report, we downloaded the [student questionnaire data file](https://webfs.oecd.org/pisa2022/STU_QQQ_SAS.zip) from [PISA 2022 Database](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/).\n\n::: callout-note\nThe data set used in student question data file is named as \"cy08msp_stu_qqq.sas7bdat.sas\".\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nstu_qqq <- read_sas(\"data/cy08msp_stu_qqq.sas7bdat\")\ndimensions <- dim(stu_qqq)\ncat(\"The student questionnaire data set has dimensions of\", dimensions[1], \"rows by\", dimensions[2], \"columns.\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe student questionnaire data set has dimensions of 613744 rows by 1279 columns.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe student-questionnaire data set includes 613,744 students from all over the world, and each of them has 1,279 information being recorded (including estimates of student performance and parent-questionnaire data).

Data Preparation\n\n**The aim of this report** is to conduct analysis on the following two tasks:\n\n1.  The distribution of Singapore students’ performance in mathematics, reading, and science.\n\n2.  The relationship between these performances with schools, gender and socioeconomic status of the students.\n\nBy examining the data of Singaporean students, it is observed that each subject—mathematics, reading, and science—has 10 [plausible values](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/httpoecdorgpisadatabase-instructions.htm)(PV). To facilitate the calculation of scores for each subject, the average of these 10 PVs is taken as the score for that particular subject. The sum of the averages for the three subjects is then calculated, and the overall average is considered as the student's overall knowledge performance score.\n\nThe socioeconomic status is most commonly theoretically conceptualized based on “the big 3” (occupational status, education, and income). By [PISA 2022 Technical Report](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/pisa2022technicalreport/PISA-2022-Technical-Report-Ch-19-PISA-Scaling-Procedures-Construct-Validation-Context-Questionnaire-Data.pdf), socioeconomic status is represented by ESCS score. The ESCS score was based on three indicators: highest parental occupation status (HISEI), highest education of parents in years (PAREDINT), and home possessions (HOMEPOS).\n\n[![](images/ESCS.png){fig-align=\"center\"}](Chttps://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/pisa2022technicalreport/PISA-2022-Technical-Report-Ch-19-PISA-Scaling-Procedures-Construct-Validation-Context-Questionnaire-Data.pdf)\n\nIn this report, only \"Vocational Training\" and \"Home Possessions\" from the above figure will be used as representatives for the analysis of socioeconomic status. By examining [the student questionnaire](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/CY8_202111_QST_MS_STQ_CBA_NoNotes.pdf), relevant questions pertaining to \"Vocational Training\" and \"Home Possessions\" have been selected to streamline data processing.\n\n\"Vocational Training\" is reflected as the following two questions in the questionnaire.\n\n| ST006 Mother's Educational level                                                                                                         | ST008 Father's Educational level                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| [![](images/ST006.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"293\"}](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/CY8_202111_QST_MS_STQ_CBA_NoNotes.pdf) | [![](images/ST008.png){width=\"292\"}](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/CY8_202111_QST_MS_STQ_CBA_NoNotes.pdf) |\n\nBy comparing parents' educational levels, this report will analyze student performance based on the highest education level attained by the parents.\n\nSelecting the following questions in the question to represent \"Home Possessions\":\n\n| ST251                                                                                                      | ST253                                                                                                      | ST255                                                                                                      |\n|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| [![](images/ST251.png)](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/CY8_202111_QST_MS_STQ_CBA_NoNotes.pdf) | [![](images/ST253.png)](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/CY8_202111_QST_MS_STQ_CBA_NoNotes.pdf) | [![](images/ST255.png)](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/CY8_202111_QST_MS_STQ_CBA_NoNotes.pdf) |\n\nThis report represents \"Home Possessions\" by adding the first six values of ST251 with the values of ST253 and ST255.\n\n# 3.

In contrast, the tails for the other two subjects as well as the overall scores are shorter, indicating a relatively concentrated distribution of data in the lower score range.\n\n### 3.2.2 Two Subjects\n\nNow, let's see if there is any correlation between the scores in any two subjects.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\np5 <- ggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n             aes(x = Avg_PVMath, \n                 y = Avg_PVRead)) +\n        geom_point(color = \"royalblue\") +\n        geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = lm, color = \"black\") +\n        geom_text(aes(x = max(Avg_PVMath), y = max(Avg_PVRead),\n                      label = paste(\"y = \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVRead ~ Avg_PVMath))[2], 2), \"x + \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVRead ~ Avg_PVMath))[1], 2))),\n                  hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1, color = \"black\", size = 4) +\n        ggtitle(\"Math vs Reading\") +\n        labs(x = \"Math Score\", y = \"Reading Score\", color = \"Math Score\") +\n        theme_classic()\np6 <- ggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n             aes(x = Avg_PVMath, \n                 y = Avg_PVScience)) +\n        geom_point(color = \"forestgreen\") +\n        geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = lm, color = \"black\") +\n        geom_text(aes(x = max(Avg_PVMath), y = max(Avg_PVScience),\n                      label = paste(\"y = \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVScience ~ Avg_PVMath))[2], 2), \"x + \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVScience ~ Avg_PVMath))[1], 2))),\n                  hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1, color = \"black\", size = 4) +\n        ggtitle(\"Math vs Science\") +\n        labs(x = \"Math Score\", y = \"Science Score\", color = \"Math Score\") +\n        theme_classic()\np7 <- ggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n             aes(x = Avg_PVRead, \n                 y = Avg_PVScience)) +\n        geom_point(color = \"tomato\") +\n        geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = lm, color = \"black\") +\n        geom_text(aes(x = max(Avg_PVRead), y = max(Avg_PVScience),\n                      label = paste(\"y = \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVScience ~ Avg_PVRead))[2], 2), \"x + \", round(coef(lm(Avg_PVScience ~ Avg_PVRead))[1], 2))),\n                  hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1, color = \"black\", size = 4) +\n        ggtitle(\"Reading vs Science\") +\n        labs(x = \"Reading Score\", y = \"Science Score\", color = \"Reading Score\") +\n        theme_classic()\n\np5/p6|p7\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the above three plots and their respective fit curves, it can be observed that the scores of the three subjects are positively correlated in pairs. As the scores in math increase, the scores in reading and science also increase, with science scores being higher. Similarly, when reading scores are higher, science scores also tend to be higher.\n\n### 3.2.3 Three Subjects\n\nNext, let's see if there is any relationship among three subject's scores.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Math vs Reading with Science\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n       aes(x = Avg_PVMath, \n           y = Avg_PVRead, \n           color = Avg_PVScience)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Math vs Reading with Science\") +\n  labs(x = \"Math Score\", y = \"Reading Score\", color = \"Science Score\") +\n  theme_clean()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Math vs Science with Reading\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n       aes(x = Avg_PVMath, \n           y = Avg_PVScience, \n           color = Avg_PVRead)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Math vs Science with Reading\") +\n  labs(x = \"Math Score\", y = \"Science Score\", color = \"Reading Score\") +\n  scale_color_continuous(\"Reading Score\", breaks = seq(200, 800, by = 100), \n                          low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"lightgreen\") +\n  theme_clean()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Reading vs Science with Math\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nggplot(data = PV_Avg, \n       aes(x = Avg_PVRead, \n           y = Avg_PVScience, \n           color = Avg_PVMath)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"Reading vs Science with Math\") +\n  labs(x = \"Reading Score\", y = \"Science Score\", color = \"Math Score\") +\n  scale_color_continuous(\"Math Score\", breaks = seq(200, 800, by = 100), \n                          low = \"red\", high = \"pink\") +\n  theme_clean()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nFrom the three colored scatter plots above, we can observe a positive trend: as the scores of any two subjects increase, the score of the third subject also tends to rise. This is visually represented by lighter colors and higher values towards the upper right corner. Conversely, when the scores of any two subjects decrease, the score of the third subject tends to decrease as well, reflected in darker colors and lower values towards the lower left corner. This pattern suggests a positive correlation among the performance scores of the three subjects, highlighting that higher scores in one subject are associated with higher scores in the others.\n\n## 3.3 Summary\n\nAfter analyzing the distribution of scores in different subjects, we can draw the following conclusions:\n\n1.  Singaporean students excel in mathematics, followed by science, with reading being the subject where they perform least well.\n\n2.  There is a correlation between the scores in the three subjects; in general, students with higher scores tend to perform well across all three subjects, while students with lower scores tend to have lower scores in all three subjects.\n\n# 4.

Both male and female students exhibit a left-skewed trend in their performance scores across the three subjects and overall.\n\n2.  In terms of math performance, female scores being concentrated around 600, while male scores are concentrated around 650 suggests that, on average, males tend to achieve slightly higher scores in math compared to females.\n\n3.  Regarding reading performance, the concentration of both male and female scores around 550-600, approximately at 580, suggests that there is a similarity in the average performance of both genders in Reading. However, the observed differences in the lower and higher score ranges indicate certain gender-related patterns. The larger area under the curve below 500 for males implies that more male students fall into the lower score range (\\<500). Conversely, the larger area above 600 for females suggests that more female students achieve scores in the higher range (\\>600).\n\n4.  In science performance, the concentration of female scores below 600 (around 580), and male scores above 600 (around 610), indicates that, on average, the majority of male students outperform the majority of female students in Science. The larger area under the curve above 600 for males in the higher score range further supports this observation, suggesting that more male students achieve scores in the upper range (\\>600) compared to females.\n\n5.  In math, science, and overall performance, the distribution of male scores is more left-skewed compared to the distribution of female scores. This indicates that, in these subjects, male scores are relatively concentrated at higher levels. A left-skewed distribution suggests that the majority of students achieve higher scores, with relatively fewer lower scores. This implies that, overall, male students tend to perform more prominently in the higher score ranges in math, science, and overall performance.\n\nThe following set of violin plots offers a clearer comparison:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\np16 <- ggplot(data = PV_Avg_gender, \n              aes(x = as.factor(gender), y = Avg_PVMath, fill = as.factor(gender))) +\n         geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +\n         geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n         scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"1\" = \"pink\", \"2\" = \"dodgerblue\"), \n                           breaks = c(\"1\", \"2\"), \n                           labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\")) +\n         labs(fill = \"Gender\", x = NULL, y = \"Math Score\") +\n         ggtitle(\"Distribution of Math Scores by Gender\") +\n         theme_classic() +\n         theme(\n           plot.title = element_text(size = 8),\n           axis.title = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.text = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.title = element_text(size = 8)) \n\np17 <- ggplot(data = PV_Avg_gender, \n              aes(x = as.factor(gender), y = Avg_PVRead, fill = as.factor(gender))) +\n         geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +\n         geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n         scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"1\" = \"pink\", \"2\" = \"dodgerblue\"), \n                           breaks = c(\"1\", \"2\"), \n                           labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\")) +\n         labs(fill = \"Gender\", x = NULL, y = \"Reading Score\") +\n         ggtitle(\"Distribution of Reading Scores by Gender\") +\n         theme_classic() +\n         theme(\n           plot.title = element_text(size = 8),\n           axis.title = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.text = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.title = element_text(size = 8)) \n\np18 <- ggplot(data = PV_Avg_gender, \n              aes(x = as.factor(gender), y = Avg_PVScience, fill = as.factor(gender))) +\n         geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +\n         geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n         scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"1\" = \"pink\", \"2\" = \"dodgerblue\"), \n                           breaks = c(\"1\", \"2\"), \n                           labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\")) +\n         labs(fill = \"Gender\", x = NULL, y = \"Science Score\") +\n         ggtitle(\"Distribution of Science Scores by Gender\") +\n         theme_classic() +\n         theme(\n           plot.title = element_text(size = 8),\n           axis.title = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.text = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.title = element_text(size = 8)) \n\n\n\np19 <- ggplot(data = PV_Avg_gender, \n              aes(x = as.factor(gender), y = Avg_PVOverall, fill = as.factor(gender))) +\n         geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +\n         geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n         scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"1\" = \"pink\", \"2\" = \"dodgerblue\"), \n                           breaks = c(\"1\", \"2\"), \n                           labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\")) +\n         labs(fill = \"Gender\", x = NULL, y = \"Overall Score\") +\n         ggtitle(\"Distribution of Overall Scores by Gender\") +\n         theme_classic() +       \n         theme(\n           plot.title = element_text(size = 8),\n           axis.title = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.text = element_text(size = 8),  \n           legend.title = element_text(size = 8)) \n\n\n\n\np16 + p17 + p18 + p19\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe violin plots for male students in math, science, and overall performance exhibit characteristics of narrower and more concentrated distributions, especially with higher scores corresponding to the widest part. This suggests that male students' scores in these subjects are more consistent and concentrated, with a substantial portion achieving higher scores. The narrowness of the plots indicates relatively small variability in scores among male students, signifying a more uniform performance. In the widest part of the violin plot, it demonstrates that a considerable number of males perform well within this score range, further emphasizing the trend of males exhibiting concentrated and superior performance in mathematics, science, and overall academic achievement.\n\nIn contrast, concerning reading, the violin plots for both male and female students are generally similar, but the female plot has higher scores corresponding to the widest part. This implies that female students generally demonstrate a more balanced performance in reading, with a relatively larger proportion of females achieving higher scores. While both plots share similar overall trends, females may have a higher average score and more instances of high performance in reading. This difference reflects the relative advantage of females in reading, showcasing a more outstanding reading ability or higher academic proficiency.\n\n### 4.1.2 Summary\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can draw the conclusion that in math, science, and overall performance, males outperform females, with a greater number achieving higher scores. In reading, the performance difference between males and females is not significant, but there tends to be a higher number of females in the high-scoring range.\n\n## 4.2 School\n\nNext, incorporating \"School ID\" into the analysis.\n\n::: callout-note\nIn the student questionnaire data set, the column \"CNTSCHID\" represents School ID.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nPV_Avg_school <- cbind(PV_Avg, School_ID = stu_qqq_SG$CNTSCHID)\nwrite_rds(PV_Avg_school, \"data/stu_qqq_SG_PV_Avg_school.rds\")\nhead(PV_Avg_school)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  CNTSTUID Avg_PVMath Avg_PVRead Avg_PVScience Avg_PVOverall School_ID\n1 70200001   605.2533   667.4296      639.7873      637.4901  70200052\n2 70200002   689.9528   627.6078      672.0703      663.2103  70200134\n3 70200003   676.7768   582.9252      660.0384      639.9135  70200112\n4 70200004   401.0528   361.3969      343.6425      368.6974  70200004\n5 70200005   436.1151   475.6763      479.2390      463.6768  70200152\n6 70200006   518.1055   431.4652      476.0031      475.1913  70200043\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis report will sum up and average the scores of survey participants from the same school to represent the school's performance score.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nschool_counts <- PV_Avg_school %>%\n  group_by(School_ID) %>%\n  summarise(STUCount = n_distinct(CNTSTUID))\ndimensions <- dim(school_counts)\ncat(\"The total number of Singaporean schools surveyed in the questionnaire is\", dimensions[1])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe total number of Singaporean schools surveyed in the questionnaire is 164\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe code chunk below calculates the mean scores for math, reading, and science, as well as overall performance, for all surveyed students in each school.

The violin plots for mathematics, reading, science, and overall performance exhibit bi-modal distributions, with a major peak concentrated in the 500-600 range and a minor peak in the 600-700 range. This suggests the presence of two distinct school groups with significantly different performance levels in these subjects and overall, with the larger group having lower performance.\n\n2.  In the box plots, the median line within the box for mathematics scores is the highest, indicating a higher median score. This implies that the median performance of students in mathematics is relatively better in Singaporean schools. The median line for science scores is the second-highest, suggesting a relatively higher median performance in science, though not surpassing mathematics. The lowest median line is observed in the box for reading scores, indicating a relatively lower median performance in reading. Overall, it can be inferred that students in Singaporean schools perform better in mathematics compared to science, and science performance is better than reading.\n\n3.  Three schools, namely \"70200001,\" \"702001010,\" and \"70200003,\" exhibit consistently high scores across subjects and overall performance. On the other hand, two schools, \"70200115\" and \"70200149,\" consistently display low scores across all subjects and overall performance.\n\n### 4.2.2 Summary\n\nBased on the previous analysis, we can observe that Singaporean schools can be divided into a group of high-performing schools and a group of low-performing schools. The number of high-performing schools is lower than the number of low-performing schools. Singaporean schools demonstrate a higher level of education in math compared to science and outperform reading. Three prestigious schools in Singapore exhibit outstanding performance.\n\n## 4.3 Socioeconomic Status\n\nIn this section, the report will sequentially select “Parent's Highest Education Level” and “Home Possessions” to represent the analysis of the impact of socioeconomic status on student performance through an examination of their influence on student performance.\n\n### 4.3.1 Parent's Highest Education Level\n\nIn the questionnaire, the educational level of parents is recorded using the [ISCED level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Classification_of_Education). This report categorizes the ISCED levels of students' parents into the following groups: ISCED Level \\<4, ISCED Level 4, ISCED Level 5, ISCED Level 6, ISCED Level 7, ISCED Level 8. The chart below illustrates the educational levels corresponding to different ISCED levels.\n\n![](images/ISCED-levels.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nComparing the ISCED levels of parents and incorporating the highest level into the analysis, the following code block implements this process:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .code-overflow-scroll  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\n# Mom's edu level\nMomEdu <- cbind(stu_qqq_SG[, c(\"CNTSTUID\", \"ST006Q01JA\", \"ST006Q02JA\", \"ST006Q03JA\", \"ST006Q04JA\", \"ST006Q05JA\")])\n\nget_highest_level <- function(row) {\n  level_column <- grep(\"^ST006Q\", names(row))\n  if (any(!is.na(row[level_column]) & row[level_column] == 1)) {\n    max_level_index <- which.max(row[level_column] == 1)\n    return(9 -

Some violin plots are uni-modal, while others exhibit bi-modal shapes. Bi-modal violin plots suggest that students of parents with the same ISCED level have scores distributed into different groups, with some achieving higher scores and others scoring lower.\n\n2.  Violin plots for students whose parents have an ISCED level of 8 (doctoral) are elongated in all three subjects and overall. This may indicate a wider distribution of scores across subjects, suggesting greater variability. This situation suggests that students with parents holding a doctoral degree show significant variations in performance, with some achieving high scores and others performing poorly. Compared to students with parents at other ISCED level, this reflects uncertainty and diversity in performance within doctoral family backgrounds.\n\n3.  Violin plots for students whose parents have an ISCED level of 6 (bachelor's) and 7 (master's) are short and stout in all three subjects and overall. This suggests that these students have a relatively concentrated distribution of scores, indicating lower variability. This situation implies that most students with parents holding bachelor's and master's degrees exhibit a relatively consistent level of academic performance, with fewer extremes of high or low scores. Compared to students with parents at other ISCED level, these students from bachelor's and master's backgrounds demonstrate a more stable and consistent performance.\n\n### 4.3.2 Home Possessions\n\nIn this section, the report will sum up some data in the student questionnaire data set that reflects aspects of home processions (HOMEPOS).

However, after reaching a certain point, there seems to be a decline. Specifically, when HOMEPOS values exceed 35, the performance in three subjects and overall appears to decrease. This suggests that an increase in HOMEPOS contributes positively to student performance up to a certain point, but when the HOMEPOS values become excessively high, student performance may start to decline.\n\n# 5. Conclusion\n\nThis report analyzes the performance of Singaporean students in math, reading, science, and overall by using the PISA 2022 data set, as well as the influencing factors. It was found that Singaporean students excel in math, followed by science, and then reading. Male students perform better in math and science, while female students exhibit stronger performance in reading. Singaporean schools are categorized into high-level and low-level groups, with the number of high-level schools being lower, including three schools with particularly outstanding performance. The study also reveals that students from families where parents have bachelor's or master's degrees demonstrate the best performance. Additionally, the home possessions positively influences students' performance to some extent.\n\n# Reference\n\n[PISA 2022 Technical Report](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/pisa2022technicalreport/PISA-2022-Technical-Report-Ch-19-PISA-Scaling-Procedures-Construct-Validation-Context-Questionnaire-Data.pdf)\n\n[PISA Data Analysis Manual: SPSS, Second Edition](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/pisa-data-analysis-manual-spss-second-edition_9789264056275-en#page1)\n\n[How to prepare and analyse the PISA database](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/httpoecdorgpisadatabase-instructions.htm)\n\n[Computer-Based Student Questionnaire for Pisa 2022 - Main Survey Version](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/CY8_202111_QST_MS_STQ_CBA_NoNotes.pdf)\n",
